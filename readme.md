# Self-Driving Car Simulation

This project is a simple browser-based simulation of a self-driving car, built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS. The simulation demonstrates basic car physics and keyboard controls, allowing you to move and steer a car on the canvas.

## Features

- Car movement with acceleration, friction, and speed limits
- Keyboard controls for forward, reverse, left, and right
- Real-time rendering using HTML5 Canvas
- Modular code structure (separate files for car logic, controls, and rendering)

## Controls

- **Up Arrow**: Accelerate forward
- **Down Arrow**: Reverse
- **Left Arrow**: Turn left
- **Right Arrow**: Turn right

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the car.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file with the canvas
- `style.css` — Basic styling
- `car.js` — Car logic and physics
- `controls.js` — Keyboard input handling
- `main.js` — Entry point, sets up the canvas and animation
